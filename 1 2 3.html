        It’s easy to look at success and attribute it to good decision making. But here’s the thing—that statement is also true the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
        Failure is not always explained by bad decision making. However, that’s what most historians do. But like Dostoevsky said, in hindsight failure is always obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
        The people who were responsible for the Titanic probably thought they were making the right decisions at the time. After the fact, they probably regretted many things.

            But I don’t think good or bad decisions have anything to do with the outcome. Peter Bevelin, the author of Seeking Wisdom, puts it well:

            “Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes and vice versa.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The truth is: You can’t predict the future. Sometimes even bad decisions can lead to good outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            So that’s why I think it’s pointless when people pretend they can teach you how to make “good” decisions. There’s no such thing. Any person who’s failed a lot in life will tell you that.

            The way you look at how something works in the real world is called a mental model. It’s your thinking framework about something.
        </p>
        <p>
            But when we make decisions, we often don’t think about our framework and immediately jump to a discussion about potential outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We ask, “What will happen if we make this decision?”

That’s an incomprehensive method because you’re not questioning your decision-making process. You’re only looking at the outcome.
